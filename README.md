# Cafelat Robot Tamper Sleeve
A 3D print to help making tamping coffee easier with the Cafelat Robot espresso maker. The odd shape and size of the Cafelat Robot filter and tamper make it difficult to apply even pressure for optimal extraction. This sleeve fits over the tamper and slides into the filter with minimal tolerance allowing for an even press.
